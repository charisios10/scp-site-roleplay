    <!-- On nuke detonation-->
    <h1>What to do on Nuke Detonation</h1>
    <p>
      When there is a lot of breaches all sid+ members must start a meeting and decide if they will detonate the nuke.
      In case of the decision to detonate the nuke, all sid+ members must give all the personel a time of usaly 5 to 10
      minutes to try to rc the breached scp's. After the time is over, 2 o5 members must take the keys and start heading
      to the nuke room. While the 2 o5s are going the other sid+ members must tell the site that the 2 o5s are heading
      to the nuke to activate the nuke and please all personel to get to the nearest nuke shelter. When the 2 o5s are in
      the nuke room, they must activate the nuke protocol and get to the nearest nuke shelter. While the timer of 120
      sec is going out the personel that are in the nuke shelter must defend it from pontetnial threats. The doors usaly
      seal themselfs when the timer is at 20 sec. When the timer is at 0 the nuke will detonate and the round will end.
