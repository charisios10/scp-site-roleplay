      <h1>What to do on Nuke Detonation</h1>
      <p>
        In case of the site being rioted with breaches and it starts to get out of control the council or the sids and
        o5s can iniciaty the warheads protocol. The warhead protocol is a nuke that resets all scps and recontains them,
        this protocol can be activated when 3+ breaches are out for a lot of time. Also the protocol can be activated
        with 2 o5s as they can only take the keys of anyone in the site. To survive the nuke you should head to the nuke
        shelter wich is located in the con 2 entrance at your left as you enter from the con 1. The nuke as also stated
        in the rules must be used as a last resort and in case of abuse there will be heavy consequences.
